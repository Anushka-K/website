    "interest": "When not negotiating time-zones, I like to explore the intersection of technology and society. When not doing that either, I like to small talk, play pretend as an actor, show my Bhangra, Swing or Contra moves and blare my British-Asian bangers from my window (previously, on my radio show).",
    "jobsearch": "As of this year, I'm also looking for full-time positions starting after my graduation in May 2021. So if you know of a Product Management, Developer, Designer position, or anything else I might find interesting, definitely hit that contact tab and let me know! (pretty plz.)",

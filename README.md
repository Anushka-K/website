# Personal Website

Here the code for my personal website, adapted from react-nice-resume by nordicgiant2, which in turn was inspired by a project by T Baker forked from [https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template), originally designed by Styleshout. I made some modifications and adjustments, thanks to the [author](https://github.com/tbakerx).
